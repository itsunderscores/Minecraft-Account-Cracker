# Minecraft Account Cracker
## C++

Bruteforce Minecraft Accounts and grab username information.
Could be improved...

- Proxy Supported
- Delay per request (Optional)

```sh
Accounts go in file: accounts.txt
Proxies go in file: proxies.txt
```

Saves output to:
- working_canchange.txt = Login successful, Eligble to change username
- failed.txt = Invalid Login
- working_cannotchange.txt = Login successful, cannot change username
